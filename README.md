# DSCI_503-Project_01

  In this project, I will be working with the gapminder dataset. This dataset contains socioeconomic data for 184 countries recorded over a period of 219 years, from 1800 to 2018. I will use the pandas library to import the data into a dataframe object. 

  First I will display the last twenty years of data for the United States. Then I will isolate the data from 2018 and create six list comprising of the countries, their populations, life expectencies, GDP per capita, Gini score, and the continents.  

  Next I will identify the countries with the largest and smallest populations, highest and lowest life expectancies, and the calculated GPD of each country.  Then I will group all the countries into regions of Africa, Americas, Asia, and Europe.  Next the total population, per captia GDP, and life expectancy of each region will be calculated for the year 2018.
